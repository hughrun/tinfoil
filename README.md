# Tinfoil README

## Intro

This is a demo system for a client-side encrypted lending library circulation system. it allows you to have users borrow items from a library without the system being able to track who has borrowed what item, whilst still being able to track relationships between items and offer borrowing suggestions.

Itâ€™s written in JavaScript using Meteor and Mylar, and is inspired by [Zoia Horn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoia_Horn).

See [https://www.hughrundle.net/tinfoil](https://www.hughrundle.net/tinfoil) for more information and background.

## Dependencies

* Meteor 1.1.3
* meteor-platform
* accounts-password
* matteodem:easy-search
* accounts-ui
* mylar:platform

## Usage

Mylar was a grad school project and does not appear to be actively maintained. Tinfoil works in Meteor v1.1.3 but has some issues in later versions - probably because of incompatibilities in Mylar's older code base - I'm not 100% sure.

To run Tinfoil, make sure you use the `--release` flag when creating your Meteor project: `meteor create myapp --release 1.1.3`. This will ensure you're using Meteor v1.1.3. **Note this version of Meteor is deprecated - use at your own risk**.

Any images, font files etc you want to use should be placed in a `public` directory and referenced directly (e.g. if you have an image file at public/foo/bar.jpg it should be referenced in your codes as 'foo/bar.jpg').

## Install locally

* [Install Meteor](https://www.meteor.com/install)
* create your app directory:

`meteor create myapp --release 1.1.3`
`cd myapp`
* add packages:
`meteor add meteor-platform`
`meteor add accounts-password`
`meteor add mateodem:easy-search`
`meteor add accounts-ui`
`meteor add mylar:platform`

* Run:
`meteor`
