# Tinfoil README

This is a demo system for a client-side encrypted library circulation system. it allows you to have users borrow items from a library without the system being able to track who has borrowed what item, whilst still being able to track relationships between items and offer borrowing suggestions.

Itâ€™s written in JavaScript using Meteor and Mylar.
